# Admin-Dashboard
This project is an admin dashboard utilizing grid styling

This project was an interesting approach for me. I think this was the first time it really clicked for me to go one step at a time with my styling.

In past projects I've gone with the "Throw everything at the wall until something sticks" approach which I think was to my detriment.

This time I went with something a bit more linear. 

<ul>Plot the webpage as a grid, add elements and styling</ul>
<ul>Build out each sub grid (header, sidebar, body, etc.) then style</ul>
<ul>Clean up any loose ends once everything has been plotted and styled</ul>


Overall learning about grid through this project taught me the power of utilizing a grid layout as well as using flexbox in some of those grids. 

I'm very excited to one day style a page like this but also plug in some Javascript in order to make the page more dynamic and alive.
